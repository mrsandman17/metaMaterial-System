# PCB Design 
The pcb was designed in Eagle and can be modified to create CRLH with diffrent parameters. 

## Tips
1. Cell blocks of the CRLH are SMD pads. Pads should be designed bearing in mind that the thickness (usally set to 35 um) and width should
  be set to give 50 Ohm impedance. 
2. Flood all the suface of the pcb with one common ground. connect all grounds, pads and connectors, to the same common ground.
